Hi, I’m JF — a **Data & Analytics professional with 20+ years of experience**, working in analytics engineering with a focus on **SAP HANA** and **SAP BW/4HANA**.

This site is my practical notebook for real-world work on **metadata, modeling, and performance**—the kind of details you only learn by building and operating analytics systems over time.

---

### What I do

* **Design and evolve SAP data models** with a focus on maintainability and clear semantics
* **Build reliable, analysis and automation** on SAP analytics technologies
* **Troubleshoot and optimize performance** across complex data flows, transformations, and query paths
* **Stabilize delivery** by turning “tribal knowledge” into repeatable checks, patterns, and diagnostics

---

### What you’ll find here

* Short, task-oriented write-ups you can apply immediately
* SQL patterns you can reuse (and adapt safely)
* Notes from real projects, edge cases, and “gotchas”
* Occasional deeper dives when the “why” is the difference between a fix and a fragile workaround

---

### How I work

I aim for **clarity, traceability, and reproducibility**. If a solution can’t be explained in a few steps—or validated with a query—I keep refining it. The goal is to make hard-to-inspect systems easier to understand, operate, and improve.

### Current SAP analytics technologies I work with (and write about)

SAP’s data & analytics stack has evolved quickly in the last few years. When I say “SAP analytics,” I’m typically talking about combinations of:

* **SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC)** — unifies key SAP data/analytics capabilities and includes managed integrations 
* **SAP Datasphere** — cloud data warehousing and semantic modeling layer
* **SAP HANA Cloud** (including data lake capabilities) — database and real-time analytics foundation
* **SAP BW/4HANA** — enterprise data warehousing on HANA

---

### Certifications

* **SAP Certified Associate – Data Engineer – Data Fabric** (SAP)
* **SAP Certified Application Associate - Reporting, Modeling and Data Acquisition with SAP BW/4HANA 2.x** (SAP)
* **Security clearance: Level II (Secret)** (Government of Canada)
* **Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate** (Microsoft)

---

### Topics I cover most often

* HANA SQL patterns for parsing, analysis, and validation
* Modeling conventions and design trade-offs (HANA + BW/4HANA)
* Performance troubleshooting workflows (from symptom → root cause → fix)
* Practical checks for pipelines, loads, and “why is this query slow today?” situations
